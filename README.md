## About
Trying to clone the complete UI for AirBnb for fun and practice. 

Right now, only the Header is done which in itself is humongous. Will add more UI elements with time.


## Run Locally
Open a terminal and copy-paste the following commands -
```
git clone https://github.com/JatinBumbra/airbnb-clone.git
```
```
cd airbnb-clone
```
```
npm install
```
```
npm run dev
```
